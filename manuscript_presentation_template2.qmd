# Motivation

## Why study “inspiration contagion” online?

In motivational communities, posts don’t just inform—**they can spread inspiration** through replies.  

::::{.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Prior work on **emotion contagion** often focuses on:
  - broad *valence/arousal*, or
  - basic emotions (e.g., happiness vs. sadness)

:::

:::{.column width="60%"}
- But inspiration is not only “positive affect”:
  - **thoughts/ideas**: e.g., evoked by scripts, lessons, narratives 
  - **self-transcendent experience**: feel hopeful and acquire a sense of self-expansion (Chang, 2023; Thrash, 2007)

## Our contribution

- We disentangle two pathways:
  - **Thought contagion**: transfer of *thematic ideas* (topics) from posts → comments  
  - **Emotion contagion**: transfer of *specific feelings* from posts → comments

- And focus on two kinds of emotions:
  - **Self-transcendent**: admiration, gratitude, optimism (Narayan and Seng, 2018)
  - **Motivation-related**: curiosity, desire, realization

---

# Research Questions

## RQs

- **RQ1:** What topics are more likely to trigger: (a) thought contagion and (b) emotion contagion?
- **RQ2:** Do inspiring posts generate more inspiring *thoughts* in comments?
- **RQ3:** Which self-transcendent emotion triggers the strongest emotion transfer?
- **RQ4:** Which motivation-related emotion triggers the strongest emotion transfer?

# Data

## r/GetMotivated at scale

- Community scale: **24M+ followers**, **23rd** largest subreddit 
- Collected: **all posts + comments** from subreddit creation **March 2010 → Dec 2022**
- Final dataset:
  - **15,793 posts**
  - **230,418 comments** (linked to posts)
  - Source URL archives from *The-Eye.eu*

## Topics as “inspiring thoughts”


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

**Topic modeling (`BerTopic`-style)**:

1. Embed: `SBERT all-miniLM-L6-v2`
2. Reduce: `UMAP` (tuned #components)
3. Cluster: `K-Means` (chosen for interpretability)
4. Tokenize + weighting: count vectorizer + c-TF-IDF
4. Represent: keywords + docs + `GPT-4-mini` + human review
:::

::: {.column width="50%"} 

**Nine topics identified:**  

1. Media, Inspiration, and Personal Stories  
2. Relationships and Personal Growth  
3. Motivational Insights...
4. Overcoming Struggles...
5. Weight loss and healthy lifestyle...
<!-- 5. Overcoming Struggles and Finding Motivation  
6. GetMotivated Community and Tools for Productivity  
7. Gratitude and Inspiration  
8. Personal Growth and Career Development Challenges   -->
9. ...

# Analytic Strategy

## Two contagion tests

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="52%"}
### Thought contagion
- **Chi-square**: post-topic × comment-topic  
- **Cramer’s V**: effect size  
- **Mixed-effects multinomial logistic model (MEMLM)**  
  - Predict *comment topic* from *post topic*
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
### Emotion contagion
- **6 mixed-effects logistic models** (one per comment emotion)
- Predict *comment emotion* from:
  - **same post emotion**
  - **other post emotions** (cross-emotion)
  - **topic** + **emotion × topic** interactions
:::

::::

# Results

## Thought contagion: strong topic alignment

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
- Post-topic and comment-topic are **not independent**, χ² = 75,648, p ≤ .001
- **Cramer’s V = 0.21** (moderate association; clear diagonal structure)
- MEMLM: strong **positive** log-odds for “matching topics”
  <!-- - **Nagelkerke R² ≈ 0.40** -->

## Emotion contagion: selective (same-emotion + cross-emotion)

- **Same-emotion transfer**
  - Gratitude → gratitude in comments: **β = 0.15**, p ≤ .01
  - Admiration → admiration in comments: **β = 0.07**, p ≤ .01
  - Optimism / curiosity / desire / realization: **ns** (no direct transfer)

- **Cross-emotion**
  - Post curiosity → more comment admiration: **β = 0.06**, p ≤ .05

---

## Topic context: boosts baseline emotion AND moderates transfer

Two roles of topic context:

1) **Baseline emotionality shifts**  
   - Topic 5 “Overcoming Struggles…” predicts higher comment:
     - gratitude (**β = 0.19**, p ≤ .001)
     - optimism (**β = 0.36**, p ≤ .001)
     - realization (**β = 0.24**, p ≤ .001)

2) **Moderation via interactions**  
   - In “Overcoming Struggles…”, gratitude is high overall, but  
     **gratitude × topic5** is **negative** (β = **−0.14**, p ≤ .01)  
     → thematic context can *weaken* direct same-emotion transfer.

# Discussion

## What we learn about “inspiration contagion”

- Inspiration spreads through **two channels**:
  - **Ideas**: topics strongly mirror between posts and comments
  - **Emotions**: transfer is selective (strongest for **gratitude**)
<!-- - Motivation-related emotions may function more as **elicitors** than “copied emotions”
  - e.g., curiosity → admiration -->
- **Implication**: designing motivational communities may require supporting both:
  1. transferable narrative “scripts” (e.g., overcoming adversity), and
  2. gratitude-rich affective framing.

# Wrap-up

## Limitations + next steps

**Limitations:**

- Text classifier measures **expressed** emotion (not felt emotion)
- Observational design: contagion ≠ causation
- Topic labels + classifier outputs introduce measurement error

<!-- **Next steps**
- Thread dynamics: depth/time decay of contagion
- User-level heterogeneity (who transmits / who is susceptible?)
- Experiments: manipulate post topic/emotion to test causal mechanisms -->

---

## Limitations + next steps

**Next steps (planned)**: Experimental priming test

- Add a **Prolific + Qualtrics + jsPsych** lexical-decision task after each post
- Two blocks per post:
  - **Emotion accessibility** (emotion targets)
  - **Topic accessibility** (topic-keyword targets)
- Stimuli: targets from cluster keywords (`KeyBERT` + `GPT-5.1); fillers + non-words **length-matched**
- Outcomes: **RT + accuracy**
- Hypothesis: faster RT for targets ⇒ increased **accessibility/priming**, offering causal evidence for mechanisms behind observed contagion
