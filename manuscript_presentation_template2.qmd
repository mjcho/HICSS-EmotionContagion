# Inspiration Contagion Effects: Elevated Thoughts and Transcendent Emotions

# Motivation

## Why study “inspiration contagion” online?

- In motivational communities, posts don’t just inform—[they can spread inspiration]{.neon-green} through replies.
- Prior work on *emotion contagion* often focuses on:
  - broad **valence/arousal**, or
  - basic emotions (e.g., happiness vs. sadness)
- But inspiration is not only “positive affect”:
  - **thoughts/ideas** (scripts, lessons, reframing)
  - **self-transcendent emotions** (e.g., admiration, gratitude, optimism)

---

## Our contribution

We disentangle two pathways:

- **Thought contagion**: transfer of *thematic ideas* (topics) from posts → comments  
- **Emotion contagion**: transfer of *specific feelings* from posts → comments

Focus emotions:
- **Self-transcendent**: admiration, gratitude, optimism  
- **Motivation-related**: curiosity, desire, realization

# Research Questions

## RQs (paper)

- **RQ1:** What topics are more likely to trigger  
  (a) thought contagion and (b) emotion contagion?
- **RQ2:** Do inspiring posts generate more inspiring **thoughts** in comments?
- **RQ3:** Which self-transcendent emotion shows strongest **same-emotion** transfer?
- **RQ4:** Which motivation-related emotion shows strongest **same-emotion** transfer?

# Data

## r/GetMotivated at scale

- Community scale: **24M+ followers**, ~**23rd** largest subreddit (at time of writing)
- Collected: **all posts + comments** from subreddit creation → **Dec 2022**
- Final dataset:
  - **15,793 posts**
  - **230,418 comments** (linked to posts)

Source archives: The-Eye.eu + Pushshift.io (URL archive)

# Measures

## Emotions from text (classifier)

- BERT-based model aligned with **GoEmotions** (28 emotions), output on \[0,1\]
- We focus on 6 inspiration-relevant emotions:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Self-transcendent**
- Admiration
- Gratitude
- Optimism
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Motivation-related**
- Curiosity
- Desire
- Realization

## Topics as “inspiring thoughts”

Topic modeling (BerTopic-style):

1. Embed text: **SBERT all-miniLM-L6-v2**
2. Reduce: **UMAP** (tuned #components)
3. Cluster: **K-Means** (chosen for interpretability)
4. Represent: tokenization + topic representation
5. Label: LLM-assisted labeling + human review

**Nine topics identified**
1) Media, Inspiration, and Personal Stories  
2) Relationships and Personal Growth  
3) Motivational Insights and Personal Growth Discussions  
4) Motivation and self-discipline strategies  
5) Overcoming Struggles and Finding Motivation  
6) GetMotivated Community and Tools for Productivity  
7) Gratitude and Inspiration  
8) Personal Growth and Career Development Challenges  
9) Weight loss and healthy lifestyle transformations

# Analytic Strategy

## Two contagion tests

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="52%"}
### Thought contagion
- **Chi-square**: post-topic × comment-topic  
- **Cramer’s V**: effect size  
- **Mixed-effects multinomial logistic model (MEMLM)**  
  - Predict *comment topic* from *post topic*
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
### Emotion contagion
- **6 mixed-effects logistic models** (one per comment emotion)
- Predict *comment emotion* from:
  - **same post emotion**
  - other post emotions (cross-emotion)
  - **topic** + **emotion × topic** interactions
:::
:::

# Results

## Thought contagion: strong topic alignment

- Post-topic and comment-topic are **not independent**  
  - χ² = **75,648**, df = **64**, p ≤ .001
- Effect size: **Cramer’s V = 0.21** (moderate association; clear diagonal structure)
- MEMLM: strong positive log-odds for “matching topics”  
  - **Nagelkerke R² ≈ 0.40**

## Emotion contagion: selective (same-emotion + cross-emotion)

From mixed-effects logistic models:

- **Same-emotion transfer**
  - Gratitude → gratitude in comments: **β = 0.15**, p ≤ .01
  - Admiration → admiration in comments: **β = 0.07**, p ≤ .01
  - Optimism / curiosity / desire / realization: **ns** (no direct transfer)

- **Cross-emotion**
  - Post curiosity → more comment admiration: **β = 0.06**, p ≤ .05

## Topic context: boosts baseline emotion AND moderates transfer

Two roles of topic context:

1) **Baseline emotionality shifts**  
   - Topic 5 “Overcoming Struggles…” predicts higher comment:
     - gratitude (**β = 0.19**, p ≤ .001)
     - optimism (**β = 0.36**, p ≤ .001)
     - realization (**β = 0.24**, p ≤ .001)

2) **Moderation via interactions**  
   - In “Overcoming Struggles…”, gratitude is high overall, but  
     **gratitude × topic5** is **negative** (β = **−0.14**, p ≤ .01)  
     → thematic context can *weaken* direct same-emotion transfer.

# Discussion

## What we learn about “inspiration contagion”

- Inspiration spreads through **two channels**:
  - [Ideas]{.neon-green}: topics strongly mirror between posts and comments
  - [Emotions]{.neon-green}: transfer is selective (strongest for **gratitude**)
- Motivation-related emotions may function more as **elicitors** than “copied emotions”
  - e.g., curiosity → admiration

**Implication:** designing motivational communities may require supporting both  
(1) transferable narrative “scripts” and (2) gratitude-rich affective framing.

# Wrap-up

## Limitations + next steps

**Limitations**
- Text classifier measures **expressed** emotion (not felt emotion)
- Observational design: contagion ≠ causation
- Topic labels + classifier outputs introduce measurement error

**Next steps**
- Thread dynamics: depth/time decay of contagion
- User-level heterogeneity (who transmits / who is susceptible?)
- Experiments: manipulate post topic/emotion to test causal mechanisms
