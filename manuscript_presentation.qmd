## What this talk is about (10–15 min)

- Online inspiration doesn’t just “feel good”—it can spread.
- We test **two contagion channels**:
  - [Thought contagion]{.neon-green}: thematic ideas in comments mirror the post
  - [Emotion contagion]{.neon-green}: discrete emotions in comments mirror the post
- Context: Reddit **r/GetMotivated** (2010–2022)

---

## Why “inspiration contagion”?

- Digital emotion contagion is well-established, but often focuses on **valence/arousal**.
- Inspirational experience is [dual]{.neon-green}:
  - **Affective**: self-transcendent emotions (e.g., admiration, gratitude, optimism)
  - **Cognitive**: thought-provoking realizations + motivating scripts
- Key idea: inspiration spreads through both [emotions]{.neon-green} and [ideas]{.neon-green}.


---

## Our contribution

1. Separate *thought* vs *emotion* contagion (they are often conflated in text-only studies)  
2. Focus on **self-transcendent** + **motivation-related** emotions  
3. Model how **topics moderate** emotion transfer


---

## Constructs + Research Questions

**Inspiration** (Thrash & Elliot): evocation → transcendence → motivation

- **RQ1:** What topics are more likely to trigger  
  (a) thought contagion and (b) emotional contagion?
- **RQ2:** Do inspiring posts generate more inspiring **thoughts** in comments?
- **RQ3:** Which self-transcendent emotion shows the strongest **same-emotion** transfer?
- **RQ4:** Which motivation-related emotion shows the strongest **same-emotion** transfer?

---

## Data: r/GetMotivated at scale

- Scraped **all posts + comments** from subreddit creation → **Dec 2022**
- Corpus scale:
  - ~15.8K posts
  - ~230K comments (paired to posts)
- Unit of analysis:
  - Post–comment pairs, with nesting accounted for in mixed-effects models

---

## Measuring emotions in text (6 targets)

We operationalize **expressed** emotions (not internal states):

- **Self-transcendent:** admiration, gratitude, optimism  
- **Motivation-related:** curiosity, desire, realization  

Method:
- GoEmotions-style classifier outputs continuous scores in \[0,1\]
- Standardize post & comment emotion scores for modeling

---

## Measuring “thought”: topic modeling pipeline

**Goal:** infer thematic ideas in posts + comments, then test alignment.

Pipeline (BerTopic-style):
1. Sentence embeddings (SBERT all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
2. UMAP reduction (tuned)
3. **K-Means** clustering (chosen for interpretability)
4. Topic representation (TF-IDF keywords)
5. Human-checked LLM-assisted topic labels

**9 topics** (example highlights):
- [Overcoming struggles & finding motivation]{.neon-green}
- Personal growth & career challenges
- Motivation & self-discipline strategies
- Gratitude & inspiration
- Weight loss & healthy lifestyle transformations
- (… plus additional motivational/community topics)

---

## Modeling strategy (what we test)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
### Thought contagion
- **Chi-square** association: post-topic × comment-topic
- Effect size: **Cramer’s V**
- **Mixed-effects multinomial logistic model (MEMLM)**
  - Predict comment topic from post topic
  - Focus: strength of *topic self→self transfer*
:::

::: {.column}
### Emotion contagion
- **Six mixed-effects logistic models** (one per comment emotion)
- Predict comment emotion from:
  - corresponding post emotion (same-emotion transfer)
  - other post emotions (cross-emotion)
  - post topic + **emotion × topic** interactions
:::

## Results 1: Thought contagion is strong (topic alignment)

**Descriptives**
- Post-topic and comment-topic are strongly associated (clear diagonal heatmap pattern)
- Cramer’s V indicates a **moderate** association (but visually very structured)

**Model-based**
- MEMLM shows strong log-odds for **matching topics** (post topic A → comment topic A)
- Largest self-transfer signals come from:
  - [Overcoming struggles & finding motivation]{.neon-green} (strongest)
  - Personal growth & career challenges
  - Motivation & self-discipline strategies

---

## Results 2: Emotion contagion is selective (and asymmetric)

### Same-emotion transfer
- **Gratitude** shows the strongest direct contagion
- **Admiration** also transfers, but smaller
- Optimism + motivation-related emotions (curiosity/desire/realization) show **no direct same-emotion transfer**

### Cross-emotion effect
- Post **curiosity** → more **admiration** in comments (curiosity inspires admiration)

*(Insert Figure: emotion contingency heatmap — “Figure 2”)*  
`![](figures/fig2_emotion_heatmap.png){width=85%}`

---

## Results 3: Topic context shapes emotionality and transfer

Two distinct topic roles:

1) **Topics elevate baseline emotionality** in comments  
   - Example: “Overcoming struggles” boosts gratitude/optimism/realization in comments overall  
   - Career-challenge topics boost optimism

2) **Topics moderate transfer** (emotion × topic interactions)  
   - Gratitude is the strongest direct contagion *overall*, but its same-emotion transfer can be **weakened** in certain themes (context-dependent contagion)

---

## What to take away

- Inspiration contagion is not “just positive affect.”
- We see:
  - **Thought contagion**: comments reliably echo the *idea structure* of posts  
  - **Emotion contagion**: strongest for **gratitude**, present for **admiration**, limited elsewhere  
  - **Context matters**: topics can amplify baseline emotionality and reshape transfer dynamics
- Practical implication: communities aiming for prosocial climates may benefit from amplifying [gratitude-rich]{.neon-green} content—but expect context-dependent effects.

---

## Limitations + next steps

**Limitations**
- Text = **expressed** emotion, not necessarily felt emotion
- Observational data → correlational (causal claims need experiments)
- Classifier + topic labels introduce measurement error

**Next steps**
- Temporal dynamics (does contagion decay across thread depth/time?)
- Incorporate richer context (user history, thread structure, norms)
- Experiments: manipulate post emotion/topic to test causal mechanisms

---

## Q&A

- Thought contagion: strongest when the post provides a [transferable narrative script]{.neon-green}
- Emotion contagion: strongest for [gratitude]{.neon-green}; curiosity can elicit admiration
- Topic context moderates both baseline emotionality and transfer

Thanks!
